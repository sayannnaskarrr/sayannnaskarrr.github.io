I'm a undergraduate student currenty pursuing my B.Sc in Zoology at [University of Calcutta](https://www.caluniv.ac.in) .Currently stuck in [Howrah](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NKDeQRk3GiiCn18x8) my hometown. I'm stuck here, but I've grown fond of the [Satyaneshi stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyanweshi_(novel)) , [Kalboisakhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalbaisakhi), and [Paturi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paturi_(Bengali_dish)). It would be shameful to call myself a [Bangali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengalis) without embracing these core traits. Perhaps these are the last memories Iâ€™ll hold on to if I leave [Bengal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal).
