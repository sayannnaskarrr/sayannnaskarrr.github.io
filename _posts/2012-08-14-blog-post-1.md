I never imagined my college would offer internships or placements, but here we are. With a less-than-stellar marksheet and even worse attendance, I’m heading for registration the day after tomorrow. Right now, it’s 01:35 AM on Mahalaya, and I should take my leave to rest. I’ll have to wake up in under three hours. Today didn’t go as planned, but life’s a mix of highs and lows—this is just a rough patch, and it too shall pass. If you’re still reading, this was simply me sharing my day and testing my website.
